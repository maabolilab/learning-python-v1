Here is a clean, student-friendly `README.md` file formatted using Markdown. You can copy-paste this directly into your GitHub repository's **README.md** file.

I have written it in simple English so kids can understand, with emojis to make it look less scary.

# 🚀 Python for Kids (Punjabi Course)

**Sat Sri Akal!** Welcome to the official code repository for our Python Course. 
This is your "Digital Schoolbag." It contains all the tools, examples, and projects we will build together in the videos.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Before we start coding, we need to set up your "Cloud Computer." Follow these 4 simple steps:

### 1️⃣ Create a GitHub Account
You need a GitHub account to save your code forever.
*   Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).
*   Sign up using your **Gmail** or any other email address.
*   *Tip:* Choose a cool username!

### 2️⃣ Fork this Repository (Make your own copy)
Right now, you are looking at *my* code. You need to make a copy for *yourself*.
*   Look at the top-right corner of this page.
*   Click the button that says **Fork** 🍴.
*   Click **"Create Fork"**.
*   Now you have this exact code in *your* account!

### 3️⃣ Start Your Computer (Codespaces)
We don't need to install Python on your laptop. We will use a super-fast computer in the cloud!
*   Click the big green **Code** button `<> Code`.
*   Click the **Codespaces** tab.
*   Click **"Create codespace on main"**.
*   Wait for 1-2 minutes. A black screen (Terminal) and a code editor will open.
*   **Verify it works:** In the bottom terminal, type this and hit Enter:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    If you see numbers like `Python 3.x.x`, you are ready to rock! 🎸

### 4️⃣ Create a Streamlit Account (For Module 5)
Later in the course, we will put our apps on the internet.
*   Go to [share.streamlit.io/signup](https://share.streamlit.io/signup).
*   Click **"Continue with GitHub"**.
*   Connect it to the GitHub account you created in Step 1.

## 📂 What is inside this Repo?

You will see some folders on the left side. Here is what they are:

### 📁 `my_lib/` (The Tool Box)
This folder contains **Pre-made Code** and Classes that I have written for you.
*   Think of this like a geometry box. You use the ruler inside it, but you don't break the ruler.
*   We will import tools from here to make our projects easier.

### 📁 `examples/` (The Playground)
This folder contains the code shown in the YouTube videos.
*   You can open these files to practice.
*   You can modify them to see what happens!

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run a File?

1.  Open your **Codespace**.
2.  Open the terminal (Press `` Ctrl + ` ``).
3.  To run an example, type:
    ```bash
    python examples/01_hello.py
    ```
